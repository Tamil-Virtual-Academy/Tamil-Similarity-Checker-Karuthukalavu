# Press Release – Similarity Checker


# Tamil Virtual Academy

Tamil has an exceptional literary tradition dating centuries. The
amount of treatises and work in Tamil since time immemorial which are
preserved in stones, papyruses and even now paper is more than any other
language. Tamil was also one of the earlier Indian languages to be
computerized. The content in Tamil in the web is far more than of other
Indian languages.

There has been a need for similarity checking systems in Tamil that
will help the authors identify other ideas that have been published before.
These similarity check systems will help prevent repetition of ideas and
thoughts between authors. Also, it will help new authors to understand what
is already done.

With the above needs in mind the plagiarism detection system for
Tamil has been developed by Dr. R. Shriram, Professor, Computer Science
and Engineering Department B.S. Abdur Rahman University with funding by
Tamil Virtual Academy. The key contributors in the project are Mr.
M.Loganathan, Mr. Ahamed Khabeer Bhadusha and Mrs. A. Radhika. The
time period of the project is 1 year for development and 1 year of support.
The key highlights of the project are

Detects exact sentence repetition

Detects word pattern repetition

Searches the web repositories for Tamil text

Focuses on Unicode based content repositories which are accessible from the web

Developed in open source framework

Presents the results in a percentage form of similarity

Opens up a new window for the results

Highlights the word patterns in the input text in the opened up separate window



The similarity detection system has been developed using the Bing search
engine as the base and can now handle a minimum of 3 sentences and a
maximum of 250 words. The size limits have been optimized such that the
end users get their results quickly and these limits will be optimized based
on the usage characteristic.The similarity detection system will prove a milestone for the authors in
Tamil as comparable similarity detection systems for English are costly and
thus inaccessible for the common users. The system is hosted in the Tamil
Virtual Academy website and has been beta tested and modified based on
the results from hundreds of users.

Researchers will benefit as they can find if their ideas have been
published already by someone or is new. They can also benefit by reading
the existing work and then forming their own work. The authors will benefit
as their work copyrights are protected. Others cannot claim ignorance as the
tools for checking are available. With the copyright laws being in its infancy
now especially for Tamil and Tamil Virtual Academy’s push towards
Digitization resulting in a large corpus being developed and uploaded into
the public domain, this work is a step in the right direction and an absolute
need of the hour. The General public will benefit from this tool as they can
evaluate the quality of writings they see in social media or blogs and
improve their own skills. They can also crosscheck the information received
with standard text. The system designed will serve as a proof of concept
prototype and spur the further development in the domain.
